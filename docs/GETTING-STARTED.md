## Step 5: Set up event details and cover photo

1. On the Event Dashboard, click **Event Settings** (or **Set up →** under "Add event details").
2. Fill in:
   - **Event name**
   - **Date & time**
   - **Location**
   - **Personal message** — e.g. *With love and gratitude, please join us…*
3. Under **Cover Image**, choose one of two options:
   - **Upload from device** — pick a photo from your computer or phone *(max 4 MB)*
   - **App photo library** — pick a celebration photo from Utsavé's built-in collection
4. Click **Save Settings**.

Your **Invite URL** appears at the bottom of the settings form — you'll use this to share with guests.

> **Cover image tip:** If you see a "too large" error, compress your photo first (e.g. using [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) — free, runs in your browser).

## Step 6: Launch your event

When your event is ready for guests:

1. From the Event Dashboard, click **Launch Event**.
2. Confirm the launch. The event is now **Live** — your invite link and QR code are active for guests.

> **Note:** Once launched, event settings (name, date, cover photo, etc.) are locked. Set everything up before launching. Draft events can still be deleted freely.

## Step 7: Share your invite link & QR code

**Option A — Invite link:**
1. From the Event Dashboard, find **Invite link** near the top.
2. Click **Copy** and paste it into WhatsApp, email, or text.
3. Guests open it in any browser — no app needed.

**Option B — QR code:**
1. On the Event Dashboard, scroll to the **QR Code** section.
2. Click **Download QR** to save the QR code as a PNG.
3. Print it on invitations, menus, or table cards.
4. Guests scan it with any phone camera to open the invite instantly.

Guests will see your event name, cover photo, and message, and can RSVP (Yes/No, name, email, optional phone and message).

## Step 8: Manage your event

From the **Event Dashboard** you can:

| Action | What to do |
|--------|------------|
| **See RSVPs** | Scroll to **Guest List**. Use **All / Attending / Declined** to filter. |
| **Export guest list** | Click **Export ↓** or **Export Excel** in Manage Event. |
| **Add guests from a list** | Click **Import CSV**, download the template, fill it in, then upload. |
| **Edit event or cover** | Click **Event Settings** *(draft events only)*. |
| **Photo gallery** | Click **Photo Gallery** to create albums, upload photos, and share with guests. |
| **Send reminders** | Click **Send Reminders** to email or WhatsApp guests. |
| **Send thank you** | Click **Send Thank You** after the event. |
| **Preview Memory Page** | Click **Memories ✦** in the nav to see the post-event keepsake page. |

## Step 9: During and after the event

### Ceremony-day slideshow
Run a fullscreen photo slideshow on any screen at the venue:
- Open `yoursite.com/event-slug/slideshow` in a full-screen browser.
- Photos from all your albums rotate every 6 seconds and refresh automatically.
- Upload new photos to any album and they appear in the slideshow within ~30 seconds.

### Guest photo uploads
Once guests verify their email in the gallery, they can upload their own photos (up to 5 at a time) from the **Share Your Photos** panel. These appear in a **"Guest Contributions"** album you can view in the host gallery.

### Memory Page (post-event)
48+ hours after your event date, the invite link automatically redirects to the **Memory Page** — a beautiful post-event keepsake showing:
- A display-only copy of your invite (no RSVP form).
- All event photos in a masonry gallery with lightbox view.
- Album filter chips that link directly to specific albums in the guest gallery.

No action needed — it happens automatically based on your event date.

## Quick reference

| Page / Feature | URL / Location |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Dashboard** | `/dashboard` — all your events |
| **Event Dashboard** | `/dashboard/events/{id}` — one event |
| **Event Settings** | Event Dashboard → **Event Settings** |
| **Invite page** (for guests) | `yoursite.com/{event-slug}/invite` |
| **Guest gallery** | `yoursite.com/{event-slug}/gallery` |
| **Live slideshow** | `yoursite.com/{event-slug}/slideshow` |
| **Memory page** | `yoursite.com/{event-slug}/memory` |
| **QR code** | Event Dashboard → QR Code section → **Download QR** |

---

That's it. Once your event is set up, launched, and the link or QR code is shared, guests can RSVP and you can manage everything from the dashboard. After the event, the Memory Page preserves it as a lasting keepsake.
