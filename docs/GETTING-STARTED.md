## Quick reference

- **Dashboard** → List of all your events; **+ Create Event** for a new one.
- **Event Dashboard** → One event: invite link, stats, setup checklist, guest list, and shortcuts to Settings, Gallery, Reminders, Thank You, Export, Import.
- **Invite link** → `yoursite.com/{event-slug}/invite` — share this with guests.
- **Event Settings** → Event name, date, location, message, cover image, and invite URL.

That’s it. Once your event is set up and the link is shared, guests can RSVP and you can manage everything from the dashboard.
