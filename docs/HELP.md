## Account & login

### How do I create an account?
Go to the home page → **Get started free** or **Create your event**. Enter your name, email, and a password (at least 8 characters), then click **Create account**. You'll get a verification email next.

### I didn't get the verification email
Check your **spam/junk** folder. If it's not there, try **Sign up again** with the same email or use **Log in** — sometimes the link was already used. Make sure you typed your email correctly.

### How do I log in?
Click **Log in** (top right or on the verify-email page). Enter the **email** and **password** you used to sign up. After login you'll go to your Dashboard.

### I forgot my password
Use the "Forgot password?" flow from the login page. Otherwise contact support.

### How do I log out?
Click **Log out** in the top-right of the Dashboard or any event dashboard. You'll be taken back to the landing page.

## Events

### How do I create a new event?
On the **Dashboard**, click **+ Create Event**. Enter event name (required), and optionally date/time and location. Click **Create Event**. You'll be taken to that event's dashboard.

### How do I edit my event (name, date, location, message)?
Open the event → click **Event Settings**. Change the fields and click **Save Settings**. Note: settings are locked once the event is live.

### Where is my invite link?
On the **Event Dashboard**, the **Invite link** is shown near the top (e.g. `yoursite.com/your-event/invite`). Use **Copy** to copy it. It's also visible in **Event Settings** at the bottom of the form.

### How do I change my cover photo?
Go to **Event Settings**. Under **Cover Image**, click **Upload from device** to pick a photo from your device, or use **App photo library** to choose a celebration photo from the built-in collection. Then click **Save Settings**.

> **Note:** Cover images must be **4 MB or smaller**. If you see a size error, use a smaller or compressed image.

### I have multiple events — where do I see them?
On the main **Dashboard** you see all your events as cards. Click **Manage →** on a card to open that event's dashboard.

### How do I get a QR code for my event?
On the **Event Dashboard**, scroll to the **QR Code** section. The QR code links directly to your invite page. Click **Download QR** to save it as a PNG image — you can print it on invitations, menus, or table cards. Guests scan it with any phone camera.

### How do I launch (publish) my event?
When you're ready for guests to RSVP, open the **Event Dashboard** and click **Launch Event**. This makes the event **Live**. Once live, event settings are locked and the QR code and invite link are active.

> **Tip:** Set up event details and upload a cover photo *before* launching so guests see a complete invite.

### Can I edit a live event?
Event settings (name, date, location, message, cover photo) are **locked** when the event is live to prevent inconsistency for guests who have already RSVPd. If you need a change, use the **Request Deletion** option and create a new event, or contact support.

### How do I delete an event?
- **Draft event:** Open the Event Dashboard → click **Delete Event**. This permanently removes the event and all its data.
- **Live event:** You cannot delete a live event directly. Use **Request Deletion** (on the Event Dashboard) to notify the admin. Provide a brief reason; the admin will review and process it.

## RSVPs & guest list

### How do guests RSVP?
Share your **invite link** (e.g. `yoursite.com/event-slug/invite`) or QR code. Guests open the link, enter name, email, and whether they're attending (Yes/No). They can add an optional phone and message. No app or account needed.

### Where do I see who RSVP'd?
On the **Event Dashboard**, scroll to **Guest List**. You'll see name, email, status (Attending/Declined), message, and date. Use the **All / Attending / Declined** tabs to filter.

### How do I export my guest list?
On the Event Dashboard, click **Export ↓** next to the guest list, or use **Export Excel** in the **Manage Event** section. This downloads an Excel file with your guest data.

### How do I add many guests at once (import)?
1. Click **Import CSV** in the Manage Event section.
2. Click **Download Template** to get the correct CSV format.
3. Fill the template (required columns: name, email, attending "Yes" or "No").
4. Click **Choose file**, select your CSV, then **Import**.
5. Check the result message (e.g. "X imported, Y skipped").

### What columns does the RSVP import need?
Use the **Download Template** from the Import panel. Required columns are **name**, **email**, and **attending** (exactly "Yes" or "No"). Other columns (phone, message) are optional.

### Can guests change their RSVP after submitting?
Submitting again with the same email will update their existing RSVP (most recent entry wins). Encourage guests to re-submit if they need to change their answer.

## Photo gallery

### How do I create a photo album?
Open the event → **Photo Gallery** → **+ New Album**. Enter an album name and create it. Then open the album to upload photos.

### How do I upload photos?
Open an album from **Photo Gallery**. Click **Choose Photos** or drag and drop images. Only image files are accepted. Photos are processed (EXIF stripped, re-encoded) for privacy before being stored.

### How do I share an album with guests?
Inside an album, go to the **Sharing** tab. Add guests by selecting them from the list (guests who RSVPd Yes) and clicking **Add**, or use **Share with All** to add all attending guests. Guests then access the gallery from a link or reminder email.

### How do guests view the gallery?
Guests open the gallery link (e.g. `yoursite.com/event-slug/gallery`). They enter their **RSVP email** and a **6-digit verification code** sent to that email. Once verified, they see the albums shared with them. The code session lasts 2 hours.

> If a guest clicks an album chip on the **Memory Page**, they are taken directly to that album in the gallery — the verification happens there.

### Can guests upload their own photos?
Yes! Once a guest is verified in the gallery, they'll see a **Share Your Photos** panel at the bottom. They can upload up to 5 photos at a time. These go into a **"Guest Contributions"** album, which you can view and manage from the host gallery dashboard.

### Can I move or copy a photo to another album?
Inside an album, use the **move** (→) or **copy** (+) action on a photo. Choose the destination album and confirm.

### How do I delete an album or a photo?
- **Album:** In the album list, use **Delete** on the album card. This removes the album and all photos in it.
- **Photo:** Inside the album, use the delete (✕) action on the photo and confirm.

## Memory page (post-event)

### What is the Memory Page?
The **Memory Page** (`yoursite.com/event-slug/memory`) is a beautiful post-event keepsake. Once your event is over (typically 48+ hours after the event date), Utsavé automatically redirects the invite link to the Memory Page. Guests who scan the QR code or open the invite link will land here instead.

### What do guests see on the Memory Page?
- A **display-only copy of the invite** (event name, message, date, venue, cover photo) — no RSVP form.
- A **photo gallery** of all uploaded event photos in a masonry grid with lightbox view.
- **Album filter chips** — tap an album name (e.g. "Family & Friends") to jump directly to that album in the gallery.
- A celebration-style design with an Indian aesthetic (gold, maroon, parchment).

### How do I preview the Memory Page as a host?
On the **Event Dashboard**, click **Memories ✦** in the nav header. This opens the Memory Page in a new tab. You can preview it at any time, even before the event date has passed.

### The Memory Page shows no photos
Photos are loaded from the albums in your event gallery. If you haven't uploaded any photos yet, guests see a "memories are being curated" placeholder. Upload photos to your gallery albums and they'll appear on the Memory Page immediately.

### Can I control when the redirect to Memory Page happens?
The redirect is automatic based on the event date. If your event date has passed by 2+ hours, the Memory Page shows. If the date is clearly in the future (more than 2 hours away), the invite page shows. Events with no date always show the invite page.

## Live slideshow (ceremony day)

### What is the Live Slideshow?
The **Live Slideshow** (`yoursite.com/event-slug/slideshow`) is a fullscreen, auto-advancing photo display designed to run on a screen during your event — like a TV at the venue. It shows all uploaded photos from your event albums, rotating every 6 seconds and refreshing for new photos every 30 seconds.

### How do I use the slideshow at my event?
1. Open a laptop or tablet connected to a display.
2. Go to `yoursite.com/event-slug/slideshow` in full-screen browser mode.
3. Leave it running — photos advance automatically.
4. Upload new photos to any album; they appear in the rotation within ~30 seconds.

### The slideshow is blank / shows no photos
Make sure you've uploaded photos to at least one album in the event gallery. If you just uploaded, wait up to 30 seconds for the next refresh.

## Reminders & thank you

### How do I send reminders?
From the Event Dashboard, click **Send Reminders**. Select **Email** or **WhatsApp**, choose recipients (attending guests), enter subject (for email) and message, then click send. WhatsApp only works for guests who provided a phone number.

### How do I send thank-you messages?
Click **Send Thank You**. Pick a template (Heartfelt, Fun & Casual, Short & Sweet) or **Custom**. Compose your message, optionally add a gallery link. Select recipients, then send.

### Why can't I send WhatsApp to some guests?
WhatsApp is only sent to guests who have a **phone number**. Ask guests to add their phone when RSVPing if you want to message them on WhatsApp later.

### Can I add a photo gallery link to my reminder or thank-you?
Yes. When composing an **email**, use the **Insert album link** dropdown to pick an album; click **Insert Link** to add the gallery link into your message.

---

## Invite page (for guests)

### What do guests see when they open my link?
They see your event name, cover photo, date/location, and personal message, plus an RSVP form (name, email, Yes/No, optional phone and message). After submitting they see a confirmation.

### Do guests need an account?
No. Guests only need to open the link and fill the form. No sign-up or login.

### The invite page doesn't show my cover photo
Make sure you've **saved** a cover image in **Event Settings**. If you just saved, refresh the invite page. If it still doesn't show, try re-uploading the image (ensure it's under 4 MB).

### Why does the invite link redirect to a different page after the event?
Once your event date has passed (48+ hours), the invite link automatically redirects to the **Memory Page** — a post-event keepsake with the invite card and photo gallery. Guests who scan the QR code will see memories rather than the RSVP form.

## Event setup checklist

The Event Dashboard shows **Event Setup** with 3 steps:

1. **Add event details** — Name, date, location, message in **Event Settings**.
2. **Upload a cover photo** — In **Event Settings**, under Cover Image (max 4 MB).
3. **Share & collect RSVPs** — Copy your invite link or QR code and share.

Complete all three steps, then **Launch Event** when ready. Once launched, the event is live and guests can RSVP.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Image is too large" error when saving settings
Cover images must be **4 MB or smaller**. Resize or compress your photo using a tool like [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) or your phone's photo editor, then try uploading again.

### "Unexpected token" or JSON error when saving
This usually means an oversized file was sent. Check your cover image size (must be under 4 MB) and try again. If the error persists, contact support with the event name.

### "Supabase is not configured"
The app needs backend configuration. This is a hosting/setup issue, not something you fix in the browser. Contact whoever hosts the app.

### "Unauthorized" or "Host profile not found"
You're not logged in or your account doesn't have a host profile. **Log in** with the account you used to sign up. If you just signed up, complete **email verification** first.

### Event settings are grayed out / can't be edited
Your event is **live**. Settings are locked to protect guest RSVPs. If you need a change, request deletion and create a new event, or contact support.

### Export or import fails
- **Export:** Ensure you have at least one RSVP; try again. Check your connection.
- **Import:** Use the **Download Template**. Keep required columns (name, email, attending = "Yes" or "No"). Check the error message for row numbers.

### Reminder or thank-you "failed" or "skipped"
- **Email:** Make sure subject and message are filled in.
- **WhatsApp:** Only guests with a phone number can receive. "Skipped" = no phone on record.

### Gallery verification code not received
Check spam. Use the same email the host used when sharing the album. Click **Resend code** if needed. The code expires after a short time — request a fresh one.

### Memory Page shows no photos / blank gallery
Upload photos to your event gallery albums first. The Memory Page pulls photos from those albums. New uploads appear within seconds of the page refreshing.
